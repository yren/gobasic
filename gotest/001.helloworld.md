* Write a test
* Make the compiler pass
* Run the test, see that if fails and check the error message is meaningful
* Write enough code to make the test pass
* Refactor

It help ensure you design good software by refactoring with the safety of tests.

As developer it's very hard to work with a codebase when failing tests do not give clear idea as what the problem is.

Ensure your test are fast and setup your tool run test simple.

`t.Helper()` is needed to tell the test suite that this method is a helper. By doing this when it fails the line number reported will be in our function call rather than inside our test helper. 

```
func TestHello(t *testing.T) {
    testCase := []struct{
        desc string
        input string
        expected string
    }{
        {
            desc: "say hello to people",
            input: "Jack",
            expected: "Hello, Jack",
        },
        {
            desc: "say hello to empty",
            input: "",
            expected: "Hello, World",
        },
    }

    assertMessage := func(t *testing.T, got, expected string) {
        t.Helper()
        if got != expected {
            t.Errorf("got %q expected %q", got, expected)
        }
    }

    for _, test := range testCase {
        t.Run(test.desc, func(t *testing.T) {
            got := Hello(test.input)
            assertMessage(t, got, expected)
        })
    }
}
```
